# hello-world
A project where I learn how to code in Python and Java. This is also where I learn about GitHub - how to manage it, create files, and how to use it.

I'm used to programming front end projects in HTML, XHTML and CSS. However, these coding skills have aged and now I'm looking into developing my earlier skills as well as learning about back end programming in Python and Java.
